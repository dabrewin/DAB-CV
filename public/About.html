<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>In my free time, I'm passionate about a range of activities:</p>
<p>I'm an enthusiastic traveler, always seeking new holiday adventures and exploring different parts of the world. Football is a big part of my life, and I stay active by playing sports and keeping fit. I'm also a big food lover and love trying new and different foods. I'm also a keen chef, patically for American-style BBQ and culinary experimentation.</p>
<p>I love going for long walks with my fiance, Louise and dog, Winnie, allowing us to unwind while enjoying the outdoors. On the tech side, I'm self-taught in web development and eagerly embrace new technological learning opportunities. Lastly, I spend some of my down time playing video games that challenge my creativity and problem-solving skills.</p>
